Projects Data analyst/science


You can find all projects under the master branch. Currently, "HousingMarketSweden" is an ongoing project expected to be completed by the end of the year. This project, like several others, involves a blend of data science and data analysis. In these projects, I have worked extensively with various aspects, including encoding text fields, processing time series data, and utilizing SQL for queries.

The remaining projects are of smaller scale and are available under their respective branches, each accompanied by a readme document that provides more detailed explanations about the projects. These smaller-scale projects also showcase my expertise in handling diverse data tasks, such as text encoding, time series analysis, and proficiency in SQL queries. Feel free to explore the readme documents for a more in-depth understanding of each project.
